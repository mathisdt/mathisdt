# Hi, I'm Mathis :wave:

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about helping people with technology or even eliminating the need to deal with technology (did I hear automation?). I like to use Java - especially in combination with the Spring ecosystem - but Python, Ruby and shell scripts are also OK for me.
