# Hi, I'm Mathis :wave:

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about helping people with technology or even eliminating the need to deal with technology (did I hear automation?). I like to use Java (especially in combination with the Spring ecosystem), Python, or shell scripting. Back in the days I also used Ruby, and I even wrote some perl code for my FHEM home automation (which was migrated to Home Assistant some time ago).

## Github is mirror-only now, see Codeberg for the real action!

**All of my active projects are migrated to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/mathisdt)**, and that's also where issues and pull requests are looked at. The Github projects are currently only a mirror of the code from Codeberg, and I won't check for issues and PRs here. Be aware that the Github projects can vanish at any point in time.

There are a number of reasons why I don't want to use Github anymore:

1. I want to promote and support open-source software, so why would I urge others to use a closed-source product (Github) when they want to interact with my projects, either by just using them or even contributing?
2. GitHub confirmed using all public code for training its LLMs, even if the license of the code requires that any derivative works have to be under the same license. I use GPLv3 for all of my projects, but the LLMs which Github (or its parent company Microsoft) publish are not licensed as GPLv3. I don't see this as fair use, so I don't want to supply my code for training.
3. The trend to offer "AI" for everything really annoys me. I use "AI" in quotes because it's not intelligent in any way, it's only a giant statistic. There are some things which "AI" can do, including dreaming up things, but it's promoted for nearly anything (including things it's clearly not up to). That doesn't make sense to me, and I don't want to support it, so I stop supporting Github/Microsoft as they try to push "AI" for everything.
